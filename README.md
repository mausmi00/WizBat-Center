# WizBat-Center

WizBat-Center is a combination of a dynamic duo of E-commerce websites (BatVault and WizCart) powered by Next.js 13, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and MySQL – think Batman and Robin but in the digital retail world. One site caters to store owners, the real heroes behind the scenes, resembling Shopify. The other caters to users, the everyday caped crusaders navigating the vast online marketplace, Amazon.

Now, let's talk about our secret weapons – meet Robin, not the sidekick, but our chatbots! The store's Robin is like a culinary wizard, adding ingredients to your cart with just a dish name. It can also help you plan meals or perform other superhero tasks because who doesn't want a shopping assistant with a flair for drama?

On the flip side, the admin Robin is the behind-the-scenes maestro, providing info on sales, products, and more. Its mission? To help admins understand what's going on in their shops and grow them faster than a well-fertilized houseplant.

Both Robins are powered by GPT-3 and LangChain for brainpower and AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and WebSocket Server for Flash-like speed. Because in the world of E-commerce, delays are the ultimate villains, and nobody likes those.

But wait, there's more! The admin webpage is so fancy it even uses DALL·E for automatic product image generation. Say goodbye to the tedious task of manually uploading images for every single item. After all, have you ever seen two stores selling dramatically different bananas? We haven't either.

For our database, we have integrated MySQL databases with AWS RDS for the store and Planetscale for the admin. The decision to utilize both platforms was deliberate, driven by a desire to explore the strengths each offers. No particular reason, just a thoughtful approach to harnessing the best database solutions. Furthermore, we have used shadcn to ensure a visually pleasing UI.
